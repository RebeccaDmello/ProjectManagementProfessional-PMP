Risk - Condition of uncertainty
~ Risk originates from a wide range of know and unknow causes within and outside the business environment
~ Risk development is indicated by a trigger condition
~ Risks can be positive or negative
~ If a risk becomes an issue, you must act!

Project Risks - SLC examples
~ Working with new vendors and building processes
~ Supply chain issues for correct bricks
~ Building code compliance
~ Key stakeholder conflict

Business Context 
~ Business risks represent an opportunity for gain or loss
~ Project risk management systematically maximized the probability of positive events and minimizes the probability and consequences of negative events
~ As project uncertainty increases, the risk of rework increases

Create Risk Strategy
~ First understand risk parameters for the org and the project!
~ Risk threshold is tied to individual and organizational risk appetities

Define risk management approach
Factor in project characteristics: Size, complexity, Importance, Development Approach

In the Plan:
Risk strategy, Methodology, Roles and responsibilities, Funding, Timing,, Risk Categories
Stakeholder risk appetite, definition of risk probability and impact, probability and impact matrix
Reporting formats, Tracking documents

Inherent Risk
- Agile projects includ risks in user stories and as part of backlog work items
- Teams discuss risks at planning meetings, during the normal course of work
- Teams place risks in a risk register, use information radiators to ensure visibility and a backlog refinement process that includes
constant risk assessment

Risk Identification Techniques
- Risk breakdown structure (RBS)
- Brainstorming
- Nominal group technique
- SWOT analysis
- Affinity diagram
- Assumption analysis
- Document review
- Delphi technique
- Monte Carlo simulation (large organizations)

Assess Risks (Qualitative then Quantitative)
- Performs the subjective qualitative assessment first
- Prioritize risks for further analysis by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact in a probability/impact matrix
- **Not every risk needs quantitative assessment

Create Risk probability and Impact definitions
- Scale, probability, Time, Cost, Quality

Probability and Impact Matrix (Impact - Severity and Probability - Likelihood)
- Use numeric values and/or colors
- If using numbers, multiply them to give a probability impact score - this makes evaluating relative priority easier
