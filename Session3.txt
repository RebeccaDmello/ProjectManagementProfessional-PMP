Topics:
1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Resources
4. Budget

Scope - It can be fixed or flexible. A project scope is the completed revitalization of Oasestown with bespoke spaces for commercial
and community tenants. The scope of the construction project is fixed. It's based on finalized blueprints and building 
compliance requirements with little room for change.

Adaptability and Resilience in planning
- Rolling wave planning
- A form of progressive elaboration applied to work packages, planning packages and release planning.
- Used in adaptive or predictive approaches

what is MVP(Minimal viable product = New product, service or result) or MBI (Minimum Business Increment = Enhancement)?
- Planning for work incrementally
- Doing the right thing, the right way

Product Roadmap
- Envisions and plans the "big picture"
- Displays product strategy and direction and the value to be delivered
- Leads with the overarching product vision and uses progressive elaboration to refine vision
- Uses themes/goals to provide structure and associations
- Provide short-term and long-term visualization

Milestones
- Markers for big events, reviews, due dates, payments or decision-making
- Prompts for reporting requirements or sponsor/customer approval
- Created by project managers, customers or both
- A milestone list identifies all milestones and indicates which are mandatory and optional

Scope Planning
- Project Manager = Facilitates the collect requirements process, documents requirements in a scope statement, work breakdown structure, develops schedule, budget and resources
- Product Owner = Creates and refines release backlog for iteration planning meeting, explains each prioritized user story in detail to the team
- Team = Estimates effort required and creates the iteration baseline, selecting stories to meet the expected velocity for the iteration.
Places user stories from product backlog into release backlog to support identified features and functions.

Starting with requirements?
- Yes ~ Predictive => project requirements are elicited and set at the beginning of the project.
- Sort of ~ => User stories are a different way of thinking about the requirements process.
- Maybe ~ Hybrid => projects may elicit and refine requirements or compose user stories.

Requirements - What are they and why do we need them?
- A requirement is one single measureable statement of condition or capability.
- It tells how a product, service or result satisfies a business need.
Guidelines for use:
- Start at a high level before providing details
- Must be unambiguous (measurable and testable), traceable, complete, consistent and acceptable to key stakeholders
