Risk - Condition of uncertainty
~ Risk originates from a wide range of know and unknow causes within and outside the business environment
~ Risk development is indicated by a trigger condition
~ Risks can be positive or negative
~ If a risk becomes an issue, you must act!

Project Risks - SLC examples
~ Working with new vendors and building processes
~ Supply chain issues for correct bricks
~ Building code compliance
~ Key stakeholder conflict

Business Context 
~ Business risks represent an opportunity for gain or loss
~ Project risk management systematically maximized the probability of positive events and minimizes the probability and consequences of negative events
~ As project uncertainty increases, the risk of rework increases

Create Risk Strategy
~ First understand risk parameters for the org and the project!
~ Risk threshold is tied to individual and organizational risk appetities

Define risk management approach
Factor in project characteristics: Size, complexity, Importance, Development Approach

In the Plan:
Risk strategy, Methodology, Roles and responsibilities, Funding, Timing,, Risk Categories
Stakeholder risk appetite, definition of risk probability and impact, probability and impact matrix
Reporting formats, Tracking documents

Inherent Risk
- Agile projects includ risks in user stories and as part of backlog work items
- Teams discuss risks at planning meetings, during the normal course of work
- Teams place risks in a risk register, use information radiators to ensure visibility and a backlog refinement process that includes
constant risk assessment

Risk Identification Techniques
- Risk breakdown structure (RBS)
- Brainstorming
- Nominal group technique
- SWOT analysis
- Affinity diagram
- Assumption analysis
- Document review
- Delphi technique
- Monte Carlo simulation (large organizations)

Assess Risks (Qualitative then Quantitative)
- Performs the subjective qualitative assessment first
- Prioritize risks for further analysis by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact in a probability/impact matrix
- **Not every risk needs quantitative assessment

Create Risk probability and Impact definitions
- Scale, probability, Time, Cost, Quality

Probability and Impact Matrix (Impact - Severity and Probability - Likelihood)
- Use numeric values and/or colors
- If using numbers, multiply them to give a probability impact score - this makes evaluating relative priority easier

Risk Register (table/columns)
- Risk Description
- Impact Description
- Impact level score => 1- low and 5- high
- Probability level score  => 1- low and 5- high
- Risk Score  => 1- low and 5- high
- Trigger Condition
- Planned Response
- Owner (who's responsible)

Risk List example:
- Working with new vendors and building processes
- Supply chain issues for correct bricks
- Building code noncompliance
- Key stakeholder conflict
- Retail market declining
- Site survey

Quantitative risk analysis methods
- Simulations
- Sensitivity analysis
- Decision tree analysis
- Influence diagrams
- Expected monetary value (EMV)

Risks ~ Time, Cost and Life Cycle
=> Predictive projects are most ofthen affected by the impact of cost-related risks, whereas adaptive projects are affected by the impact of time-related risks

Risk Response
- appropriate for the significance of the risk 
- Cost effective
- Realistic within the project context
- Agreed to by the relevant stakeholders
- Owned by a responsible person

Risk Response Strategies
- Threat = Escalate, avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept
- Opportunity = Escalate, exploit, share, enhance, accept

Quality
The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements.
Include:
- Stakeholder expectations and end-user satisfaction
- Compliance with standards and regulations
- Continuous improvement

Quality standards and Regulations are crucial in an org to maintain the work flow
- Standards = Documents established as a model by an authority, custom or by general consent. Example: Dictionary
- Regulations = Requirements that can establish product, process or service characteristics
- Metrics = Metrics measure desired quality attributes for your product or project through testing, use of tools, processes
- six sigma(aka lean six sigma) = DMAIC framework (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) = focus on relevant topics

Integrating Plans
- The scope, schedule, budget, resources, quality and risk plans must support desired outcomes
- An integrated view of all plans can:
Identify and correct gaps or discrepancies
Align efforts and highlight how they depend on each other - so your team works better
Help assess and coordinate the project during its life cycle
** The result of this step is an Integrated project management plan

Tuckman Stages of Team Development
- Forming = team members meet and begin to trust one another
- Storming = team members begin to assert themselves and take control of emerging issues
- Norming = team begins to work productively without worrying about personal acceptance or control issues
- Performing = Team is working at optimum productivity and is colloborating easily, communicating freely and solving its own conflicts
- Adjourning = Team members complete their assigned work and shift to the next oriject or assigned task

Virtual Team Member Enaggement
- Manage engagement by focusing on:
~ Team dynamics, transparency, accountability, attention to effective communication

Virtual Team Best practices
- Manage risk of "feeling isolated"
- Focus on shared commitments and team goals vs. individual accomplishments
- Instill a sense of shared commitment

Where and how the team works
- Colocation, if possible
- Factor in environment and location to team performance
- Foster meaningful interaction to support autonomy
- Respect agreed team working hours and practices

"Agile" space for Hybrid teams
- Ensure private spaces for those who need to work in solitude

Work Information Management Systems
- Project Management Information System (PMIS)
Gather, integrate and share project data
Ensure consistency in collection and reporting

Artifacts Management Systems
- Store and maintain project artifacts
- Microsoft SharePoint or Teams, Google Drive

Importance of Artifacts
- Artifacts enable reconstruction of the history of the project and to benefit other projects
- Project teams create and maintain many artifacts during the life of the project
