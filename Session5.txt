Assess Current CI methods
How well are the team and organization equipped for CI?
= Use the risk register to assess current CI measures. It includes how the team is prepared to act address the threat to project quality,
so it can be helpful way of assessing current CI changes

Conduct Retrospectives (went well and Need to improve)
- Review and Improve methods
- On a board, make two columns: "what went well" and "what could be improved"
- Ask attendees to add items to these lists
- Allow each participant to identify the reason for the improvement
- Decide common items that need improvement and mark them
- Narrow the list to those improvement areas that will bring value in the next sprint
- Get team consensus on the plan improvement
- Update these tasks on the backlog after a discussion with the product owner

Lead with an improvement Mindset
- Educate yourself
- Encourage a "fail fast" mindset
- Identify material improvements, training, processes or equipment
- Measure the effect of any change
